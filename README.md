I came up with the idea to work on a project with a group of my biomedical engineering peers to help out the visually impaired. 
We used a combination of Arduino, SolidWorks, various sensors, a breadboard, and also a speaker to create a sensor that beeps and alerts the person when an obstacle is within a certain distance in front of them. 
This product was designed to help avoid accidents and also provide a more effective replacement for a cane.
